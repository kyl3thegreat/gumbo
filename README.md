*Mission Statement:*

They can go into "Get Started" and they are asked what kind of food, how much they are willing to spend, and how far they are willing to travel.  This will match with other users who are looking for similiar results.  This app makes the meeting location a local place to eat, making it a social environment to avoid unwanted meet-ups.
